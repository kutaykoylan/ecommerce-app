--api-tests--

-entity ids that comes with eventsourcing are changed with actual entities.
-there is no need for delay in requests' tests anymore.
-there is an implicit check mechanism in event sourcing for the createOrder endpoint
-version,history that comes with event sourcing is not used anymore because those variables ensures the eventual
consistency of event sourcing.
-although some delay exists for the requests contains kafka , it is so small compare to delay in ES that can be
neglected.


--integration tests--
-with the absence of event sourcing , we don't have to test kafka contracts of create operations since they are done by JPA
repositories
    - For CQRS , commands are event (kafka topic).
-Since there is no event sourcing framework in non-CQRS project, we do not need to implement another method to see how
messages are consumed. Because event sourcing hides the kafka details from outside.


--implementation and performance difference--
